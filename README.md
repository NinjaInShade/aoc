My advent of code submissions!

Start by running `pnpm i` to install node types.

Running a submission logs the part 1 and 2 results for that day.

To run a submission, first add an `input` file (no extension) in each day directory for that year's submissions (e.g. 2024/1/input and so on...)

Once that is done, execute the command below (if not specified, year defaults to current year and day to 1).

```bash
pnpm start <year> <day>
```

You can also run this with `DEBUG=1` to also log out the input.
